# Backlight

Bash Script to Set Your Backlight Brightness  

For whatever reason, one day after putting my laptop to sleep (a ThinkPad T530 running Debian 9.1) `xrandr` became disconnected. After I rebooted, `xrandr` was working properly again, but tools like `xrandr` and `xbacklight` weren't able to set my backlight's brightness... so I wrote this script.

I haven't managed to get it working with my function keys yet.
